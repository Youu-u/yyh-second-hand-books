            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3 id="consignment">How to Sell Your Book?</h3>
            <p>We operate on a consignment model. You submit your book details on the <a href="sell.html">Sell to YYH</a> page, and we'll arrange a campus pickup. Once your book sells, you'll receive payment via bank transfer within 5 business days. Unsold books can be returned to you upon request.</p>

            <h3>How to Buy a Book?</h3>
            <p>Go to the <a href="buy.html">Buy</a> page, fill out the form with your details, and select a book. After submitting, you'll need to pay via PayPal within 24 hours (include your Book ID in the payment note!). We'll then arrange a campus pickup.</p>

            <h3>What Happens If I Donâ€™t Pay Within 24 Hours?</h3>
            <p>If payment isn't received within 24 hours, your order will be canceled, and the book will be available for others to purchase.</p>

            <h3>Can I Return a Book?</h3>
            <p>We accept returns within 7 days if the book is in the same condition as purchased. Email us to arrange a return and refund.</p>
