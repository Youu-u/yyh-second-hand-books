            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                We are a <strong>100% student-run non-profit organisation</strong> at Methodist Ladies’ College.
                Our team members are <strong>Yuhan Yang (Year 10), Aries Luo (Year 10), and Avni Hedge (Year 10)</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Despite our busy academic life, we personally code the site, evaluate product prices,
                and handle product transfers — all to contribute to our planet’s wellbeing. We are committed
                to environmental protection, and all trades are conducted in an environmentally-friendly way.
                <strong>All profits are donated to environmental charities</strong> to help protect our Earth.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our trading method requires <strong>no trucks and no flights</strong> — only our own hands
                and legs to complete product hand-overs. On campus, we provide a platform for students to trade
                products, and we only charge <strong>10% service fee</strong>. Delivery is fast and produces
                <strong>0 pollution</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                For second-hand books, we strongly support re-use, so our service fee remains only 10% —
                <strong>much lower and faster than many other second-hand book platforms</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you have any further questions, feel free to message any of us:
